Symmetrical Drawing
=================

I implemented a symmetrical drawing application in JavaScript.

Press the spacebar to change the color.

Press the up key to increase the brightness or the down key to decrease the brightness.

Press the up key to increase the saturation or the down key to decrease the saturation.

Use the drawing application with [this link](https://symmetrical-drawing.glitch.me/)!
